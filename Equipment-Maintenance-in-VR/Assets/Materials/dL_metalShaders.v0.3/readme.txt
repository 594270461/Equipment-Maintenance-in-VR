Right now, there's only metal shaders because I create 3d metals for a living so it was a natural starting point for me.   But I plan on growing these shaders beyond just metal as I have the time.  Check my website for updates.

Update history
-----------------

v0.3 - August 2009 - Switched all shaders to mia_material_x instead of mia_material_x_passes.  You can upgrade these shaders automatically in Maya 2009 and Maya 2010 by going to "Upgrade Shader" in the attribute editor for these shaders.  Two new metal types added, "dull metal" and "scratchy metal".  To save space in the download, the HDR image was replaced with a procedural texture.

v0.2 - July 2009 - Added an aluminum shader.

v0.1 - July 2009 - Brushed and generic (polished) metal shaders were created using mia_material_x_passes and added to the dL_metalShaders.ma file.
